# Invited talk for ISI-WSC 2019 in Kuala Lumpur

## Session

> **The Real Work of Data Science: How to turn data into information, better decisions, and stronger organizations**

>The role of data science in organization, research, and education is evolving. This  invited paper session will provide an opportunity to discuss this evolution by addressing current and future challenges. The session will include presentations and discussions on topics such as behavioral data analysis in healthcare and beyond, the role of analytics in social research, and advanced analytics in the Industry 4.0 context. Besides these applications areas, talks in this session will address issues such as privacy, ethical considerations, and information manipulations.

## My talk

**Title**: Forecasting is not prophecy: dealing with high-dimensional probabilistic forecasts in practice.

Many large organizations need to forecast huge numbers of related time series every week. Manufacturing companies forecast product demand to plan their supply chains; call centres forecast call volume to inform staff scheduling; technology companies forecast web traffic to maintain service levels; energy companies forecast electricity demand to prevent blackouts. In each case, what is required is a high-dimensional probabilistic forecast describing multivariate quantiles of the uncertain future, not a vector of point forecasts.

This raises several difficulties:

  1. it is analytically and computationally challenging to produce probabilistic forecasts for very high-dimensional time series;
  2. users find multivariate probability distributions difficult to use and interpret;
  3. the predictive accuracy of a high-dimensional probability distribution is not easy to measure.

I will discuss these problems and how they can be tackled.
